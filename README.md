# Final-Project-Transforming-and-Analyzing-Data-with-SQL

## Project/Goals
The project goals are as follows:
- To determine the relationships and connections between the different tables in the ecommerce database
- To identify problems with the data and create solutions that work
- To ensure that the data can be used to answer questions, to make good business decisions

## Process
- Created the ecommerce database on pgadmin
- Imported the csv files to create the tables
- Cleaned the data: removed the duplicates, null values
- Assigned the primary and foreign keys
- performed quality assurance

## Results
- the dataset had a lot of duplicates, empty columns/null values
- I discovered that 148,642 visitors were not socially engaged, and using the COUNT and DISTINCT function gave the same result
- I discovered that the United states is the country with the top selling product, the product being mountain veiw
- USB wired soundbar is the product with the highest sentimental value


## Challenges 
- the first challenge was assigning the primary and foreign keys. I was trying to assign these keys when I had not cleaned the data, and because there were duplicates, I could not assign the keys when creating the table. So I had to create the table first, cleaned the data - remove the duplicates, before I could assign the primary and foreign keys.
- the other challenge I encounterd, which was a really big one, was, when I was almost done cleaning my data, my computer did an update and a restart, and by the time it came back on, I lost all my tables. I asked for assistance and Rachel was able to help recover public tables.

## Future Goals
If I had more time, I would create more questions that will link two or more tables together to practice joins.  Also, I would find ways to do more cleaning on the data, and do QA on the data to make sure
the data is of good quality
